# culture-emotion-attention
This is a study on how culture and age can influence where individuals attend to when they look at emotional pictures, and how their gaze consequently affects their mood.  
All the analysis files are under [GRF1314_Rproj](./GRF1314_Rproj), which already includes an R project file for RStudio. Data files are referenced to in the analysis scripts.
The study was conducted in Boston, US (121 older adults and 105 younger adults) and Hong Kong (65 older adults and 96 younger adults). Participants were either induced to feel sad, or were let to maintain a neutral mood. They then viewed positive, neutral and negative pictures, some of which were more relevant to Western cultures, others to the Chinese culture. All participants were eye-tracked throughout the experiment.
