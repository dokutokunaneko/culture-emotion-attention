# culture-emotion-attention
This is a study on how culture and age can influence where individuals attend to when they look at emotional pictures, and how their gaze consequently affects their mood. The study was conducted in Boston, US and Hong Kong. Participants were either induced to feel sad, or were let to maintain a neutral mood. They then viewed positive, neutral and negative pictures, some of which were more relevant to Western cultures, others to the Chinese culture. All participants were eye-tracked throughout the experiment. Additional information on hypotheses are available upon request.

The analysis makes use of crossed-random effect model (linear mixed model), which has rarely been used in social-cognitive psychology research, but is increasingly popular in ecology, linguistics, etc., and is incredibly powerful and flexible. The data are analyzed at the trial level, allowing for missing data due to eye-tracking calibration quality, and also incorportaing person-level predictors.

All the analysis files are under [GRF1314_Rproj](./GRF1314_Rproj), which already includes an R project file for RStudio. Data files are referenced to in the analysis scripts.
